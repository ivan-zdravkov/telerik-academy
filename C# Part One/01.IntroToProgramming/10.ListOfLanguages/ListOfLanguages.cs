/*
 *      These are the languages I am familiar with:
 *
 * 	    C - Has all the basic functionality, functions, blocks, modules, libraries. 
 * C is the middle ground between High level programming languages and Aseembly. 
 * Can be used for Microcontroller programming, drivers, I/O systems and more...
 * The difference with C# is it has no classes and is not object oriented.
 *
 *	    C++ - Adds Object Programming to C. Classes, Methods, etc. It's a direct
 * descendant of C, as the name sudgests. Was very popular in the past, now it is slowly being 
 * replaced by more popular languages.
 * The difference with C# is that C# is newer and easier language, also multyplatform one.
 *
 *	    Java - A multyplatform language. Uses Java Virtual Machine to run apps to any
 * Operating System that can run a Java Virtual Machine. Widely spread and popular. Used in
 * many devices for many different tasks. The Applications generally run slower than Apps 
 * specifically written for any Operating System. 
 * C# was designed as a Microsoft's direct answer to the Java technology.
 *
 *	    Assembly - A close to machine code language. Used for simple taskts. 
 * A line of assembly code is a machine instruction for the processor to process. Most processors
 * have their own set of instructions. Many languages often compile their code into *.obj files,
 * that can be executed from the processor. C# compiles into files, that are run by the CLR.
 * Aseembly languages have little in common with C# in terms of sintaxis and logic. 
 *
 * 	    HTML - A language used to display content in the web browser. 
 *	
 *	    PHP, CSS - The languages, which give additional functionality to the HTML pages.
 *
 *	    JavaScript - Used for web content, and applications.
 *
 *	    SQL - A database language
 *
 *      The later 5 are WEB based languages and have little in common with C#
