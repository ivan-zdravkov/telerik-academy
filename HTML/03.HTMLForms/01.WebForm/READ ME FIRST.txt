I am using a javaScript script that automatically changes the phone fields, 
and the birth day fields to the next ones when I reach the end of the previous.
The script can be found at: http://www.idocs.com/tags/forms/index_famsupp_162.html
I have changed it a bit, so it works for my phone and birth date input fields!

Please check it out!
