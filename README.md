#My Telerik and University Projects

Welcome to my GitHub account.
Here you will find the projects I have done for the [Telerik Academy](http://telerikacademy.com/), and some other projects I did as a university student in C and C++.

I am no longer uploading my projects on GitHub and am instead using [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/IvanZdravkovBG/)
